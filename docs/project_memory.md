## 2026-07-21 — Memory-grounded layered Schema foundation

Completed the new infrastructure described in `temp.md` while preserving the
legacy single-layer ARC schema for compatibility.

Key decisions:

- Concrete task logs live in the new `socialclaw.memory` layer.
- A `SchemaNode` is a generalized world rule and keeps source, positive, and
  negative memory IDs as auditable evidence.
- Level `0` is most general; larger levels are more specific.
- Parent/child and same-level similarity links are symmetric and validated.
- LLM induction returns a structured `create`, `merge`, or `skip` proposal.
- Embeddings and the LLM are dependency-injected; offline deterministic
  behavior remains available for tests and empty-project bootstrapping.
- Reliability feedback, task masking, forgetting decay, duplicate
  consolidation, and atomic persistence are implemented.
- `build_schema_system()` constructs and restores the complete memory/schema
  stack from a state directory.

Primary guide: `docs/schema_architecture.md`.

Verification at completion: `.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`
passed all 25 tests. No live model/API call was made.

Likely next step, only when requested: migrate the ARC schema runner/parser to
write `MemoryRecord` episodes and consume `SchemaManager` retrieval. The old
runner is intentionally not silently switched because experimental behavior
and stored artifact formats would change.
