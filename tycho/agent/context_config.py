"""Single source of truth for Tycho's context-management + prompt-caching config.

WHY THIS EXISTS (the bug class it kills): caching was governed by TWO independent, badly-named env
vars that had to BOTH be set for frontier-model caching to actually work, and both defaulted to the
NON-caching value:
  - TYCHO_CONTEXT_MODE=legacy  (history STRUCTURE — 'legacy' mutates old turns each turn → cache-hostile)
  - LLM_PROMPT_CACHE=off       (whether provider cache-control markers are sent at all)
'legacy' was an overloaded catch-all: falling back to it silently changed history structure AND killed
caching AND (via 'rolling') could select a deprecated path — several side effects behind one word. A run
could "have caching on" in one sense and off in another, invisibly. The $6K no-cache H025 surprise was
exactly this: the run defaulted to legacy/no-cache and nothing surfaced it.

THE FIX:
  1. ORTHOGONAL, self-describing switches — history structure, prompt caching, and image retention are
     independent fields, no catch-all string that bundles them.
  2. CACHE-FRIENDLY DEFAULTS — prompt_caching ON + history=tail_evict (the prefix-preserving design from
     docs/context-caching-design.md), so caching is the default you'd have to deliberately turn OFF.
  3. RESOLVED CONFIG IS LOGGED + STAMPED (startup log + manifest) — a silent revert becomes immediately
     visible because the resolved values are printed and saved with every run.
  4. BACK-COMPAT — old env names still work (mapped here), so the other agent's existing invocations and
     the pinned eval clones don't break; the new names take precedence.

vLLM (Qwen/Gemma) auto-caches by prefix and ignores the Anthropic markers, so prompt_caching=on is
harmless there and tail_evict helps every backend (stable prefix → KV/prefix-cache reuse). The markers
specifically help providers with explicit prompt-cache controls.
