"""Cheap world-model-divergence signal for the `trigger` mode builder condition.

The `trigger` mode fires the builder when the current world model is detectably wrong on the observed
trace. "Wrong" has TWO independent channels in the Moore machine M=(St,s0,Acts,δ,Ω,ρ,T):

  1. DYNAMICS — δ∘ρ is not accepted for an observed grid (simulation_accuracy < 1.0). A wrong
     transition or render. (s0/hidden-state errors surface here too, as a downstream render mismatch.)
     simulation_accuracy uses bounded observation_variants() when the model supplies them; strict
     canonical render accuracy remains separately reported as strict_simulation_accuracy. render()
     may use UNKNOWN=-1 for genuinely unclaimed cells, but a very low prediction_coverage is treated
     as inaccurate so trigger mode cannot go quiet on an all-unknown model.
  2. OUTCOME — outcome() disagrees with observed terminal evidence:
       level_complete too_loose : outcome() returns "level_complete" on a state that was NOT a
                   level end. This is PLANNING-CRITICAL: the planner steers toward a phantom terminal.
       level_complete too_tight : outcome() misses a solved level's terminal. Only knowable once a
                   real terminal is observed, i.e. at a level boundary.
       game_over missed/too_loose: outcome() misses an observed API GAME_OVER, or returns "game_over"
                   on an ordinary decision frame.

Historically this probe checked only channel 1, so a model with perfect dynamics but a wrong terminal
predicate could go quiet. Both channels are checked now, in ONE subprocess (verify + verify_outcome
share the model import).

Computing this must be CHEAP — it runs on every committed turn. It is one sandboxed subprocess: the
AGENT-AUTHORED world_model.py must execute under the SAME sandbox as run_python (it can import the
engine otherwise), so we evaluate it via ToolExecutor._run_python (Baseline B sandbox, stale-.pyc
handling). Both verify and verify_outcome are CPU-only numpy over the observed trace — milliseconds; the
subprocess startup dominates, and combining the two channels into one script pays that once.

Conservative default: if world_model.py is absent/unloadable/crashing, dynamics is reported wrong
(there is no model → the builder SHOULD run to bootstrap one); outcome is reported clean (a model that
can't load can't have a committed-but-wrong outcome — let the dynamics arm drive the first build).
