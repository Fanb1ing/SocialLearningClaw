"""Tycho — Freeform agent: an unconstrained file-system agent harness.

The A5 redesign taken to its conclusion (docs/a5-scientist-archetype.md motivated it;
Tycho is the tool-native realization). Instead of reassembling a structured prompt and
parsing a tool choice each turn, Tycho runs ONE GROWING CONVERSATION per game in which the
model freely:
  - reads the workspace (frames as hex + PNG, exact diffs, scene graphs) via base tools
    it's trained on (ls / read_file / run_python),
  - writes/revises beliefs to notes/actor_beliefs.md (notes/world_model.md in single mode);
    this prose IS its captured reasoning — which matters because Opus 4.8 doesn't expose
    reasoning summaries from providers that expose them, and in orch/trigger mode it is also the actor-to-builder channel,
  - commits exactly ONE scored world action via take_action, which ends the turn.
No experiment/explore/plan scaffolding — the agent decides its own scientific flow.

Mechanics:
  - Native tool use through a provider-neutral `chat_tools` protocol.
  - The current frame's PNG is attached in-context each turn; older frames stay on disk,
    retrievable by tool. Hex grids older than TYCHO_GRID_KEEP turns are dropped from context
    (kept on disk + as diffs) so the 64x64 grids don't bloat the conversation.
  - One conversation spans the whole game: take_action's RESULT is the next frame, which
    the harness feeds in on the following choose_action — a natural append flow.

Env: LLM_BACKEND/LLM_MODEL, TYCHO_EFFORT (defaults LLM_EFFORT), TYCHO_MAX_TOOL_STEPS (cognitive
tool calls per turn before a forced action; default 25), TYCHO_MAX_LLM_CALLS (whole-game
ceiling; default 1100 — on hit the agent STOPS cleanly via is_done, it does NOT autopilot),
TYCHO_MAX_INFERENCE_COST_PER_GAME / _PER_LEVEL (frozen public-list USD equivalent; 0 disables),
TYCHO_GRID_KEEP (turns of grid/image kept in context; default 3),
TYCHO_VISION (attach current-frame PNG; default on), TYCHO_MAX_TOKENS (default 16000),
TYCHO_TOOL_FLAVOR (tool naming: claude|gemini|generic; default auto from the model).
