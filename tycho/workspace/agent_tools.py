"""Tycho base tools — the file-system + compute primitives an LLM agent is trained on,
scoped to a GameWorkspace, plus the world-action and zoom tools. No experiment/explore/
plan scaffolding — the agent decides its own flow.

MODEL-SPECIFIC TOOL NAMES (#13): models are post-trained on particular tool names.
Opus knows Claude-Code names (Read/Write/Edit/Bash); Gemma knows Gemini-CLI names
(read_file/write_file/run_shell_command). We expose the native names per model but map
them to ONE internal executor — names are just labels, behavior is identical. Pick the
naming with tool_specs(flavor=...).

`take_action` is handled by the agent (parses the move + ends the turn); the rest run
in ToolExecutor. Grids everywhere are SPACE-SEPARATED single chars (one token/cell, #16).
