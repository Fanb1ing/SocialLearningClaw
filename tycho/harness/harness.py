"""Evaluation harness: drives the local arc-agi engine, enforces the
RHAE action budget, computes scores, and writes a structured result record.

Design notes
- Bulk evaluation runs offline against the local `arc-agi` engine. One online call downloads and caches each game
  (incl. per-level human baselines) to `environment_files/`; afterwards no
  network is needed. This is what makes fully-offline runs viable.
- `available_actions` from a frame are game-action ints; RESET is a separate API control.
- Level transitions are implicit: `levels_completed` increments and the engine
  advances; `state == WIN` means all levels done. We detect a level completion
  by a rise in `levels_completed` and attribute the actions since the last
  completion to that level.
- Budget: per the report, official eval terminates a level after `5 * h`
  actions. We enforce the same so local scores are not optimistically biased.
